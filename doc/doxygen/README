Quick notes for generation of doxygenated FLEXPART code.

Don Morton, Don.Morton@borealscicomp.com

------------------------------------------------

This assumes you have a pretty full Doxygen installation, which may take
a little effort to set up.

In general, you need to have a "flexdoc" configuration file and, if it's 
properly set up, all you need to do is

doxygen flexdoc

and the whole documentation tree will end up in a new "html" directory.
It actually produces a "latex" directory, too, but I've chosen not to keep
that.

In this directory, I've placed a flexdoc configuration file that's set up
perfectly.  The two things you would most likely want to change would be

PROJECT_NAME

and

INPUT

I have also found that if you already have an "html" directory, it may 
contain some old stuff when you're done, so it's best to just remove it
and start fresh.
