############  Don's notes
# As Delia states below, it seems that CTBTO NCEP data does 
# not have LSPREC.  I leave it in the code and in the Vtable, 
# but we need to look into this. Same with CONVPREC.
# Same with TCC.  I don't see anything like it in the 
# CTBTO NCEP data.

#
#
#  Vtable for NCEP model-level data in GRIB2
# typeSurf = typeOfFirstFixedSurface
# indOfParam = indicatorOfParameter for GRIB1
# typeofLeve for GRIB 1 is equivalent to indicatorOfTypeOfLevel
# NOTES FOR DON:
#   New variable RH was in ECMWF QH --- QH is obtained from RH in the readwind_gfs code
# - SLP is read in initially to get params but it is in fact the MSL
# - new variable HMIX -- mixing height
# - new variables *SIG1 -- new variables used to calculate fluxes and stresses
# - ETADOT is not existing, but there is the vertical velocity. I leave the same ETADOT FP name... or shall we call it WW? just a change in name

#! There is no ParamId or infofParam from the GRIB files!!!  

# RH in readwind_gfs.f90 code has number 1 but the GRIB files have it 0! I have checked with grib_dump
# readwind_gfs.f90 tries to get the total cloud cover, but it is not in the GRIB data
# NCEP data in our case_data does not have Total Cloud Cover! it tries to read it, but it is not in the files.  
# ... we DO HAVE TCC in the data we get at ZAMG
# precipitation is complex. I find only frozen precip fraciton in the files, but readwind, reads some parameters
# ... that are tp and convprec if GRIB2!! our test data has no precipitation data. In the data we get at ZAMG
# ... we DO HAVE total precipitation data and Convective precipitation!!! 
# ... LSPREC is actually total precip .... but I insist, we do not have water precip in our case data!!
# ALso at ZAMG we have relative and specific humidity! what does CTBTO have?
# ALso funny, in readwind_gfs it says that td2 is calculated because it is not in GFS data
# ... but we have it in the data and we do not have the relative humidity at 2 m
